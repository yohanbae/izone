Produce48 is a audition program. They run the competition for 100 days with 12 episodes. The program was on air on 2018 and final 12 compeititors were survived.
<br><br>
Many people predicted that wonyoung would win the competition from the very beginning. Her overwhelming beauty caught all the viewers from the first episode and her skills were pretty enough for her visual. 
<br><br>
Surely the visual wasn’t only reason of her success since there were other beauties as well. We believe her amazing performance was the main reason. She had to go through 5 performances and she performed with different concetps from cutie to sexy concept and caught all viewers heart.
<br><br>
She was bright all the time. She personalty was humble but she never hegitated to express herself on the stage. Her qualification as a center was proved through the five competitions.

Even though her final rank was 2, she had the most issues during produce48. Every her moves were written as a news post. Because she was already super star from Japan and her visual caught new fans in Korea.
<br><br>
Sakura was the beginning of the produce 48. Korean viewers watched her for the first time through the produce 48 teaser video clip ‘nekkoya’. Because she was the center of the ‘nekkoya’ performance and Korean was curious about the beautiful center of produce 48.
<br><br>
She was one of the few Japanese challengers who got A class from the first test during the show. However she had a tough time just like other traniees since the produce 48 judges required strict standards. Especially she had to go through her schedule in Japan as well, so she had to work harder than other trainees. Nevertheless she showed us the perfect performance on every stages.

Sakura already debuted in 2011 as AKB48 the popular Japanese girl band. She was one of the most popular member that used to be a center from many stages and main actor in Japanese tv series. She even run her own radio program with her name. We believe her talants were developed through the career.
<br><br>
She was already super star in Japan and her future was guaranteed. However, her admire for the kpop made her to challenge the produce48 audition. Her great challenges made more fandoms through produce48.

Actually she had debuted before produce48 back in 2013. The name of the band was YE-A and her nickname was Caju. It’s very difficult to find the band’s information since the group wasn’t popular at that time. There were over population of girl groups in that era and only few girl band survived. Unfortunately YE-A couldn’t survived. Eunbi left the group in 2015 and move to wooling entertainment.

She was one of most issuing member during produce48. She started with F class, but no one could expect her future due to her big fandom. Especially, everyone thought she might lose on her first competition but she survieved.
<br><br>
The reason her skill is lower than others is that she didn’t have enough trainee period. She had to keep moving her company before her debut and was preparing to be an actor.
Shedidn’t give up even her skill wasn’t great and that caught viewers heart. And heart rank was keep going up and finally she joined izone with rank 7.

She is one of the most talented member as well. Her charming points are her cute face with skinny body, fast dance move and her special voice. Even her body is small and skinny, her dance move is very powerful, fast and clean.<br><br>
Her voice is obviously great gift and it brings more female fans. She was rank 10 at the final episode of produce48, but now she is most popular member in Japan.<br><br>
You will find her special voice in the every tracks. Since she has a powerful vocal skill, she always take cover the chorus part with Yuri.

Actually there’s not many things to be describe about her from the produce48 since she didn’t get many camera shot during the show. And that was pretty disadvantage for her because it’s hard to developer the bigger fandom with less camera shot. However, she was talented enough to gather fandom with only performances.
<br><br>
Especially, her third competition performance is called as legendary among the fans. She was the center of the performance ‘to reach you’ and her beauty and voice was perfectly fit to the song.

Even she is one of the most beautiful member, she always had less confidence in the produce 48. However every episodes showed us how she get growing up and getting better, it caught the viewers attention. In the first, she didn’t even volunteer to be a center since the lack of confident, however she volunteered herself at the last competition. The performance becomes one of the greatest performance in the show.
<br><br>
The reason she has no confident is because of her past company kept changed plan of her debut. She supposed to debut long time ago but always cancelled at the last moment. As she said something negativeness inside of her mind because of the continuous failure. However she never gave up and it touched viewers. Finally she become iz*one with rank 11.

"La Vie en Rose" is described as a vibrant, groovy electropop track. Captivating from the get-go, "La Vie en Rose" blends a wide range of elements – ambient synths, stomping beats, tinny snare and echoing strings drive much of the track – in its attempt at achieving midtempo pop perfection. The melody soars with the members’ vocals, exploding with a pre-chorus build and sudden drop to the more restrained titular hook, serving up an introductory track that is all at once powerful and delicate.[1] The song was composed and produced by the MosPick Music Producing Group from Cube Entertainment which is known for producing successful releases such as 4Minute's "Crazy" and HyunA's "Lip & Hip".

As I look at you (ye)<br>

Imaginations move my emotions even more<br>
Rainbow with twelve different colors<br>
Which color am I?<br>
Shall we make it even brighter?<br><br>

On top of the white paper we are drawing slowly one by one<br>
(Red orange yellow green blue indigo violet, which color fits us?)<br>
I am always next to you<br>
I will always be with you<br><br>

Oh this beautiful color<br>
I keep getting drawn by it without me knowing<br>
Put it into that pretty sky<br>
I want to draw myself<br><br>

A secret just between the two of us will open baby<br>

My lips, as if I’m a magic shop I become colored as well<br>
First period is art because I want it to be<br>
I feel like I’ll float into the air my heart starts to thump<br><br>

On top of this black and white world<br>
I have colored it with my own color, ooh<br>
Since all of us who are different gathers<br>
It already became an awesome picture<br><br>

Each color has a certain feel to it all<br>
Since it spreads out electrifyingly<br>
Look into my eyes<br>
The way we want<br>
(We can do it all)<br><br>

From our fingertips to the tips of our toes<br>
It all sparkles like the starlight<br>
Look into my eyes<br>

This good feeling of always wanting to color<br>

I shake your heart so I can see it alone<br>
Color that is put inside a transparent cup<br>
Becomes electrifying<br>
This good feeling of always wanting to color<br>

The light in your eyes gets deeper<br>
And inside my reddened heart burns up and makes me dance<br>
(Ooh) Don’t forget the rose that is standing here<br>
(Ooh) So it can shine whenever<br><br>

Somehow this feeling feels perfect<br>

The glistening eyes just like a ruby<br>
All eyes, all eyes on me (ey)<br>

And inside my reddened heart burns up and makes me dance<br>
(Ooh) Don’t forget the rose that is standing here<br>
(Ooh) So it can shine whenever<br><br>

(Ooh) This is my, my<br>
La la la la vie en rose (rose)<br>
(Ooh) Oh it’s my, my<br>

Open the eyes that you have closed<br>
Everything will become different<br>
Look at the world that is unknown to everyone else, oh baby<br>
La la la, la la la, la vie en rose<br>
Color everything red<br>
La la la, la la la, la vie en rose<br><br>

I don’t care if this is a dream, color me red<br>
I’ll call you so you can always wake up<br>
(Ooh) Don’t forget the rose that is standing here<br>
(Ooh) So it can shine whenever<br><br>

La la la la vie en rose (la vie en rose, hey, yeah!)<br>
(Ooh) This is my, my<br>
La la la la vie en rose (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)<br>
(Ooh) Colored with the rose<br>

Bright red, my rose (my rose, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)<br>
It shines, my rose (yeah)<br>
La la la la vie en rose<br>
Making this moment special (we’ll make it red)<br>
Oh it’s my, my<br>

First, my diary that is full of my dreams<br>
To me this is a memory that spent long nights<br>
You may laugh because it may be a little young and childish<br>
These were very desperate sides of mine of the past<br>
It may be a little tough<br>
I may cry<br>
The looks I got saying it’s not gonna work<br>
Whenever that happens<br>
Draw the far future I have always dreamed of<br><br>

The hard times are now disappearing<br>
I’ll become a bright light and sing songs for you, harmony<br>
A very secret time of mine where I preciously have dreamed<br>
You and I (we) have desperately<br>
Prayed for it<br><br>

First, my diary that is full of my dreams<br>
To me this is a memory that spent long nights<br>
You may laugh because it was a bit of an immature dream<br>
But these are still my valuable memories<br><br>

It may be a little tough<br>
I may cry<br>
The looks I got saying it’s not gonna work<br>

Draw the far future I have always dreamed of<br>

A very secret time of mine where I preciously have dreamed<br>
You and I (we) have desperately<br>
Prayed for it<br><br>

The moments where I was very hurt<br>
And also the times where I waited for so long<br>
Sometimes I’d just want to drop down and rest<br>
When a faint starlight dreams<br>
Then someday it will shine brightly<br>
‘As I believe so, I’ll stay strong<br><br>

The hard times are now disappearing<br>
I’ll become a bright light and sing songs for you, harmony<br>
A very secret time of mine where I preciously have dreamed<br>
(Secret time)<br>
You and I (we) have desperately<br>
Prayed for it

If I were to convey my feelings<br>
Just with words<br>
I think it would disperse from the wind<br>
In front of the word “Goodbye”<br>
My heart feels uneasy<br>
And so,to the front of the door of the wide and endless world<br>
You have brought me there preciously<br>
Your my angelIn your two hands<br>
I want to fill it up<br>
With my courage<br>
So the repeating days can become<br>
A precious “today” to me<br>
Though we don’t know what’s to come tomorrow<br>
For me to show you more of how I am<br>
Please take care of me from now on<br>

For me to show you more of how I am<br>
Please take care of me from now on<br><br>

The doodles I’ve drawn on my heart<br>
These insignificant scribbles<br>
When you look at them, it becomes a dream<br>
You walked a step behind me<br>
You didn’t leave<br>
My backside lonely<br><br>

Even if I fall and run out of breath walking<br>
If all this can become your happiness then<br><br>

In your two hands<br>
I want to fill it up<br>
With my courage<br><br>

So the repeating days can become<br>
A precious “today” to me<br>

Then we can look at each other oh yeah<br>
Comfort each other and hug each other<br>
Please protect the special heart<br>

Our worlds is getting bigger day by day<br>
I get surprised too and my eyes widen (to me)<br>

When you’ve tried so hard Oh Oh Oh<br>
But didn’t get the results you wished for<br>
You seem so upset<br>
What should I say to you?<br>
Dreams don’t come true that easily<br>
Everybody knows that<br>
You don’t even have time<br>
To wipe of your sweat<br><br>

Until<br>
Yesterday<br>
Her ranking was beneath me<br>
But now<br>
She’s<br>
On top<br><br>

When I see you cry like that<br>
It makes me fall for you<br>
Trying your best and putting in all your effort<br>
Is always beautiful<br>
Makes me want to support you<br><br>

I’m on your side<br>
I’m on your side<br>
I’m on your side<br>
Can’t take my eyes off you<br>
I’m on<br>
Your side<br>
Hang in there<br>
I’m on your side<br><br>

When nobody is watching you Oh Oh Oh<br>
You always blame yourself<br>
But you’ve tried hard enough<br><br>

Whatever<br>
I say<br>
To comfort you<br>
You’ll just say that results<br>
Are all that matters<br><br>

When I found out how vulnerable you are<br>
It made me fall for you even more<br>
I just want to be there for you<br>
The way you struggle to be better<br>
Never give up<br><br>

Never give up<br>
Never give up (Ooh whoah)<br>
Never give up<br>
There’s always tomorrow<br><br>
You<br>
Can do this<br>
This is just beginning<br>
Never give up<br><br>

From tomorrow<br>
You’ll be a different person<br>
Find the new you<br>
Tsu tsu tsu<br>
Stay strong<br><br>

When I see you cry like that<br>
It makes me like you even more<br>
Trying your best and putting in all your effort<br>
Is always beautiful<br>
Makes me want to support you<br><br>

I’m on your side<br>
I’m on your side<br>

Lost alone in the deep woods<br>
I stopped and looked back for a moment<br>
The road gets further and I’m very scared<br>
But the sudden coincidental sunlight<br>
That warmly shone on my heart was you<br>
From that day on<br>
I have dreamed<br><br>

At times it’s hard<br>
And even if I’m exhausted<br>
For you, I won’t go back<br><br>

Please remember Dear my friends<br>
As I dream<br>
Wherever it is, I can reach it with my thoughts<br>
Even if I think it’ll disappear<br>
I’m always by your side<br>
Close both your eyes and draw your ears in<br>
All the days we’ve spent together<br>
Uhh Woo Uhh<br>
Lalala Lalala<br>
Lalala Lalala<br><br>

I followed the tip of my foot and passed the woods<br>
I’m standing on top of a small cliff<br>
I now know<br>
Where I am (where I am)<br><br>

Everything looks so small<br>
So I’m nervous that I’ll go further away<br>
But I’ll put all the time I’ve spent walking here on the line<br><br>

At times it’s lonely<br>
And even when I flop down<br>
In the end, I didn’t give up<br><br>

Please remember Dear my friends<br>
As I dream<br>
The raindrops that dropped will all become the light<br>
And will shine on you once more<br>
The tears we’re shedding right now<br>
Probably can’t be stopped but<br>
I’m thankful we were together<br><br>

Thanks to the warm sunlight that comforted my exhausted self<br>
I was able to come this far<br>
You’re my friends (you’re my friends)<br><br>

Please remember Dear my friends<br>
As I dream<br>
The times we have skid by and lost<br>
Even if I think it’ll disappear<br>
I’m always by your side<br>
Close both your eyes and draw your ears in<br>
Just like that day, we’ll be together<br><br>

Even though we’re saying our last farewells<br>
I’ll wait, let’s become the light and meet again<br>
We’re in the same dream<br>
The steps we’re taking together<br>
We’ll never halt<br>
I was happy we were together<br>
Uhh Woo Uhh<br>

Lately it's only me<br>
Who says "I miss you", isn't it?<br>
Over and over, persistently<br>
But you keep inviting me<br><br>

That shining diamond<br>
Have you left it somewhere and forgotten it?<br>
Hey remember it, one more time<br>
Make me excited like you used to<br><br>

People tend to take love for granted<br>
If you don't check on it after a while, it will disappear<br><br>

I'll make you say you love me for sure<br>
You'll be the one who says it<br>
I'll make you say you love me<br>
Won't you kiss<br>
I'll make you say yo love me<br>
Look into my eyes<br>
I'll make you say you love me<br>
Won't you kiss<br>
Even if you hug me<br>
I can't feel it<br>
Please say it properly with words<br>
Won't you kiss<br><br>

If you look away and leave me alone<br>
Then I can do the same thing too<br>
To not interfere each other<br>
Seems like it'd be nice if such a rule existed<br><br>

I played strong and tried to say it<br>
But I can't do such a thing<br>
Hey please look here a little<br>
Even though I'm screaming from the bottom of my heart<br><br>

Love slowly loses its balance<br>
If we don't support it with kindness, it'll finally collapse<br><br>

Because of that, please say that you love me<br>
Isn't it simple?<br>
Please say that you love<br>
One more kiss?<br>
Please say that you love me<br>
It's fine even though it's late<br>
Please say that you love me<br>
One more kiss<br>
If you don't want to lose me<br>
Let me hear<br>
More about your feelings<br>
One more kiss<br><br>

Hey are you planning to make me the only one who says it?<br>
If you don't say it as much as I do<br>
I won't believe<br>
Your love<br><br>

I'll make you say you love me for sure<br>
You'll be the one who says it<br>
I'll make you say you love me<br>
Won't you kiss<br>
I'll make you say you love me<br>
Look into my eyes<br>
I'll make you say you love me<br>
Won't you kiss<br>
Even if you hug me<br>
I can't feel it<br>
Please say it properly with words<br>
Won't you kiss

I feel like I’m being peeped<br><br>

I closed my eyelids (eyelids)<br>
Misunderstood (Sorry)<br>

I was upset by not being there<br><br>

What kind of face should I face? suddenly…<br>
From here onwards is a problem (awkward …)<br>

I can not come back.<br><br>

No!<br>

I can not say anything<br>
As if I nodded (Maybe)<br>

I’m relieved to be able to sleep<br><br>

Passing through passion<br>
Let’s become easy<br><br>

Give up!<br>
I want you to notice<br>
To love<br>
To be hungry<br><br>

From me (wow …)<br>
I hug you (wow …)<br>
I feel calm<br>
It’s absolutely boring.<br><br>

Ashamedly (wow …)<br>
Let’s be bold (wow …)<br>
Because it is the same even if you go bumpy (psychological game)<br>
Because I feel emotional (Taka) Only spinning<br><br>

That is love<br>
Even if I become infatuated … Of course<br>
It’s okay (not changed)<br>
It will be to become<br><br>

Let’s go easy<br>
No!<br>
Absolutely not!<br>
In love<br><br>

No matter how much we love each other<br>
Suddenly suddenly<br>
our relationship ends<br>
It's not about possibilities, but mistakes of the heart<br>
mistakes in fate<br>
But it was a truly wonderful love<br><br>
 
A happy goodbye<br>
Can't shed no tears<br>
I'm feeling fine<br>
Because I still love you and that doesn't change<br>
Goodbye with a smile<br>
Thank you for so many memories<br>
Thank you<br>
Somehow happy<br>
I won't be able to see you tomorrow, but I pretend to be strong<br>
Strange<br><br>
 
Why, why don't I feel sad?<br>
Even though everyone is worried about me<br>
Because I knew that I'd wake up from my dream someday<br>
on the expiration date of love<br>
Looking back, I have no regrets<br>
No regret saying goodbye to you<br>
Don't need no consolation<br>
No need<br><br>
 
For some reason, now I don't feel lonely at all<br>
Goodbye facing forward<br>
You pushed my back and gave me courage<br>
You've been a nice person.<br>
I'm glad I met you<br>
Heartbreak<br>
The best‼︎<br><br>
 
Please go now<br>
Right now<br>
Please turn away from me<br>
If you look at me I will change my mind<br>
While it's still positive, let's close the door of love<br>
I don't want to hate you<br>
I wanted an ideal goodbye<br>
It was my wish<br>
Even though such parting cannot exist<br><br>
 
A happy goodbye<br>
Can't shed no tears<br>
I'm feeling fine<br>
Because I still love you and that doesn't change<br>
Goodbye with a smile.<br>
Thank you for so many memories<br>
Thank you<br>

I like the way it is right now woo<br>
I don’t need the gazes outside the window<br>
This moment, I want to dream of things I want a little more<br>
I want to know the “me” inside myself more<br>
I wanna be a cat<br><br>

I wanna be a cat<br><br>
I wanna be a cat

On top of the snug sofa<br>
The morning sunlight pouring in<br>
Continuously makes me roll around inside the cozy blanket<br>
Inside this slowly flowing time<br>
I dream a new dream everyday<br>
This slow and leisure daily life, this time is what I like<br><br>

This time that passes will never comeback<br>
Don’t care for anybody else, this moment only for yourself<br><br>

I like the way it is right now woo<br>
I don’t need the gazes outside the window<br>
This moment, I want to dream of things I want a little more<br>
I want to know the “me” inside myself more<br>
I wanna be a cat<br><br>

You know, alright? Woo<br>
You know, alright? Oh<br>
You know, alright? Hey<br>
About yourself<br>
About yourself<br>
I know, alright? Woo<br>
I know, alright? Oh<br>
I know, alright? Hey<br>
About myself<br>
About myself<br><br>

I wanna be a cat<br>
I wanna be a cat<br><br>

The shaking curtains, the feel-good breeze<br>
It tickles me as if it’s trying to whisper into my ear<br>
Wherever it is I like it, Whenever it is I like it<br>
That gently blowing breeze is calling for me<br>
I want to walk more, do you want to join<br>
Do you want to walk inside the breeze with me<br><br>

The feel-good breeze<br>
The slow flowing moment, and you<br>
Don’t worry about anything, that’s more than enough, that’s all you need<br><br>

I like the way it is right now woo<br>
I don’t need the gazes outside the window<br>
This moment, I want to dream of things I want a little more<br>
I want to know the “me” inside myself more<br>
I wanna know more<br><br>

Ah, inside the door gap that has opened carefully<br>
A small light shines on me<br>
Follow my footsteps one by one, stay close and believe in yourself<br><br>

I like whichever sort of image you have woo<br>
You’re more important than the gazes outside the window<br>
Because you are the one that’s more important than anything else<br>
Just the way you want it<br>
I wanna be a cat<br><br>

I like the way it is right now woo<br>
I don’t need the gazes outside the window<br>
This moment, I want to dream of things I want a little more<br>
I want to know the “me” inside myself more<br>
I wanna know more<br><br>

You know, alright? Woo<br>
You know, alright? Oh<br>
You know, alright? Hey<br>
About yourself<br>
About yourself<br>
I know, alright? Woo<br>
I know, alright? Oh<br>
I know, alright? Hey<br>
About myself<br>
About myself<br>

あれからいくつか恋して<br>
大人になったけど<br>
あの頃　踊ってたような<br>
ダンスは覚えていない<br><br>

風はいつも通り過ぎて<br>
どこか消えてしまう<br>
心を揺らしても<br>
そこにはいてくれない<br>
空に浮かぶ白い雲は<br>
ただ流されながら<br>
何かを言いたげに<br>
季節を見送るだけ<br><br>

そんなにせっかちな<br>
あなたにあきれて<br>
ねえ　ときめきを思い出すまで<br>
このまま<br><br>

愛を急がせないでよ<br>
もっとゆっくりと<br>
時間をかけて<br>
バラの花びらが<br>
いつか開く日まで<br>
美しいままで<br>
胸の奥　ちゃんとしまってた<br>
その想い　あふれ出しても<br>
夢なのか　現実なのか<br>
簡単に手を出せないでしょう<br><br>

何度も恋には破れて<br>
少しは慣れたけど<br>
一途な感情で動く<br>
ダンスを思い出せない<br><br>

道にできた日向なんて<br>
やがて陰って行く<br>
いつでもそこにある<br>
ぬくもりが欲しいのに…<br>
世界中を探したって<br>
きっと見つからない<br>
一人にされるなんて<br>
信用できないでしょ？<br><br>

そういう身勝手な<br>
自分の性格<br>
愛想つかして嫌になるまで<br>
無視して<br><br>

愛を踊らせないでよ<br>
その気になったら<br>
光の中で<br>
バラのとげさえも<br>
意味があることに<br>
そう気付くはずよ<br>
誰のため踊るのでしょうか？<br>
太陽に問いかけてみた<br>
木漏れ日が降り注ぐだけ<br>
ご自由に…　見物してちょうだい

Your eyes that are glistening brilliantly<br>
Only look at me<br>

Gather up a bunch of love inside my eyes<br>
I just look at you<br>

The gently blowing breeze is electrifying<br>
The love I received from you<br>
Fills me uh<br>
Blueish blueish it’s filled up in that sky<br>
All the places where I reach my arms out<br>
Becomes my own rainbow<br><br>

The place the sight of our eyes meet<br>
Is a pretty song of ours that we dream of<br>
You who has stopped in its tracks after following my mysterious scent<br>
I like the way it shines<br>
Just like this, it twinkles up in the sky<br><br>

Oh my goodness (Oh yes)<br>
It’s filled with your breath (It’s warm)<br>
We who dreamed, this moment makes me surprised even more<br>
When your hands touch the colored sky<br>
The mixed color of ours spreads<br>
We create our own miracle<br><br>

You, the sunlight it pours down like a picture<br>
I have already filled my heart with you colors<br>
And my heart has been throbbing all day<br>
You should draw as well, together (together)<br>
Sweet day and you will like it (Like it)<br>
If we’re together we’ll sprakle even more<br>
The feel-good breeze, please come closer to our side<br><br>

I can feel the scent even when I close my eyes, oh<br>
It’s gentle so I fall into it<br>
I follow the light that has disappeared far away<br>
I get closer to you, closer to you, ah, ah<br><br>

Your eyes that are looking at me and the color of light that shines on me<br>
It makes everything stop, it makes you shine even more<br>
Suddenly you are blending into me quietly<br>
Since we’ll be dreaming the same dream<br><br>

That wide world<br>
Draw it in front of your eyes, feel your sincerity<br>
You who you have hidden inside of you<br>
Open it up to the world just as is, the feeling right now as it is<br>
Show yourself to me<br><br>

You’re my violeta<br>
All of it to me<br>
You’re my violeta<br>
Everything to me<br>
You’re my violeta<br><br>

You, you, you, would you trust me?<br>
Would you open your heart up more to me<br>
Gathering up your mysterious color of light<br>
It resembles me who will let you shine<br>
So, you can shine more than anybody else<br>
So, you and I can be together<br><br>

Spread beautifully, the world that has been filled with your scent<br>
Open your heart to it, I listen draw my ears closer to you<br>
I shine on you from inside, I color you in eternally<br>
You will be dazzling even more so<br><br>

Into the sky that resembles yourself<br>
Your hidden feelings, the moment you were waiting for<br>
The “you” that you’ve been wishing for, gather them up in the sky<br>
Just as is, the feeling right now as is, show yourself to me<br><br>

You’re my violeta<br>
All of it to me<br>
You’re my violeta<br>
Everything to me<br>
You’re my violeta<br><br>

I’ll wait for you whenever<br>
Since I’ll always be by you<br>
More than a splendid spotlight, with more of the shining light for you<br>
Since I’m only for you<br><br>

You’re my violeta<br>
All of it to me<br>
You’re my violeta<br>
Everything to me<br>
You’re my violeta<br><br>

Your smile that has been drawn on that sky<br>
It’s shining brightly oh<br>
The beautiful flower inside your heart<br>
You’re my violeta<br>
I’ll protect you, I’ll shine on you brightly<br>
You’re my world, You’re my light, oh my heart<br>

Woo really really like you<br><br>

I’ve been waiting since a long time ago<br>
With the sound of Spring that comes after the cold Winter<br>
Unknowingly, my heart that has been asleep is now running<br>
I am reminded of that time<br><br>

I remember<br>
That day we first met<br>
I think we were very cold<br>
Cuz I’m with you<br>
Passing by the freezing Winter<br>
The sprouts grow<br><br>

Really like you, please hold my hand tight<br>
Please don’t let go of this hand<br>
So we can dream while holding onto our warm hands<br>
I really like you, I really really like you<br>
Since I’m with you I am able to dream a brightly shining dream again tonight
With you<br><br>

You became my outer wear for the cold wind<br>
The countless number of stars we at above<br>
The moment our eyes locked, my courage sparkles<br>
There’s no need for words, we can do everything<br><br>

The stars in the night become the light<br>
The songs of the small birds starts<br>
Along with the melody, you and I start to dance<br>
Forever with us<br><br>

The great times, our memories<br>
From one to ten we were in it together, always together<br><br>

I remember<br>
The day we first met, it must’ve been particularly colder<br>
Cuz I’m with you<br>
Passing by the frozen Winter, the sprouts grow<br><br>

Really like you, please hold my hand tight<br>
Please don’t let go of this hand<br>
So we can dream while holding onto our warm hands<br>
I really like you, I really really like you<br>
Since I’m with you I am able to dream a brightly shining dream again tomorrow<br><br>

I think I really like you, I think of us on that day once more<br>
I wish that our dreams that grew since yesterday would reach the sky<br>
You and I, following the shining dream<br>
We walk a step forward, a step forward<br><br>

Really like you, I’ll hold your hand tight<br>
I’ll not let go of this hand<br>
Hold onto both warm hands and look at the sky<br>
I really like you, I really really like you<br>
If we’re together, we can shine whenever forever<br>
With you

The night where everyone is deep asleep<br>
I open the windows right now<br>
I spread both my wings with a shaking heart<br>
For some reason more, something more<br>
I think that place that is filled with new things are calling for me<br><br>

Don’t ever stop<br>
Hang in there for a little longer<br>
The ocean view that is spread across my eyes<br>
If I go a little further<br>
It is said that my dream I’ve wished for will spread across the cozy clouds<br><br>

My heart tells me it’s now<br>
That the moment I’ve been waiting for has come<br>
To spread my wings that I’ve been withdrawing<br><br>

Fly Airplane<br>
Following that shining star<br>
Perhaps finding a stage that is waiting for me<br>
An Airplane that will float a little higher<br>
A-A-Airplane<br>
A-A-Airplane<br><br>

A.I.R.P.L.A.N.E<br>
Going higher following that airstrip of the starlight aha<br>
A.I.R.P.L.A.N.E<br>
Going further passing the hibernating horizon<br><br>

Everyday I’m very excited<br>
Wherever I go, there are only things that are dazzling uh huh<br>
Even when it rains I’m humming<br>
I’m not far from the amazing world since I’m the one to meet it<br><br>

Don’t be too hasty, take your time baby<br>
Just like the numbers that are on the dashboard<br>
I’ll have to solely follow your speed<br>
So I can be stable through any sort of air current
<br><br>
That wind tells me not to hide<br>
That it’s my time to shine<br>
To be a little more courageous<br><br>

Fly Airplane<br>
Following that shining star<br>
Perhaps finding a stage that is waiting for me<br>
An Airplane that will float a little higher<br>
A-A-Airplane<br>
A-A-Airplane<br><br>

A.I.R.P.L.A.N.E<br>
Going higher following that airstrip of the starlight aha<br>
A.I.R.P.L.A.N.E<br>
Going further passing the hibernating horizon<br><br>

Baby baby if you’re ready to be with me<br>
Then would you mind turning on the engine of your sleeping heart<br>
Baby baby just like the twinkling stars above
Would you fly higher woo ah<br><br>

Fly Airplane<br>
Flying above the blue sea, further and further<br>
Over the horizon to see the unseen<br>
We’re just like<br>
Just like an Airplane<br>
A-A-Airplane<br>
A-A-Airplane

Let's go up high to the end of the blue sky<br>
You and I together, forever together<br>
Look around, look at the world<br>
The scenery where we were together are beautifully spread across<br><br>

Let’s meet eyes and breathe heavily<br>
Whoo woo whoo woo<br>
Our faces are spreading without limitations across the wide sky in blue<br>
Please hold me hand<br><br>

Go up the the end of the sky<br>
Go above the clouds<br>
The ocean-colored scenery is wonderful, it's endlessly spread across<br>
I wish the time would stop<br><br>

To the sky, you and I<br>
To the sky, we fly up<br>
To the sky<br>
Whether this is a reality or a dream it doesn't matter<br>
To the sky<br>
Go up, go up, go up<br><br>

When the cool breeze grazes my cheeks<br>
Our memories, with a smile on our face<br>
Write it on the clouds so it won’t disappear<br>
Whenever I want to see it, I'll be the only one to take it out and see it<br><br>

Let's meet eyes and breathe heavily<br>
Whoo woo whoo woo<br>
Our faces are spreading without limitations across the wide sky in blue<br>
Please hold me hand<br><br>

Go up the the end of the sky<br>
Go above the clouds<br>
The ocean-colored scenery is wonderful, it's endlessly spread across<br>
I wish the time would stop<br><br>

To the sky, you and I<br>
To the sky, we fly up<br>
To the sky<br>
Whether this is a reality or a dream it doesn't matter<br>
To the sky<br>
Go up, go up, go up<br>

My heart that floats, you and I inside the clouds<br>
Our image that reflects upon your eyes<br>
I want to give every pretty thing to you<br>
My love<br><br>

The ocean-colored scenery is wonderful, it's endlessly spread across<br>
I wish the time would stop<br><br>

To the sky, whenever it is, always remember this day<br>
To the sky, let's call each others' names<br>
To the sky<br>
Whether this is a reality or a dream it doesn’t matter<br>
To the sky<br>
Go up, go up, go up

I like the way it is right now woo<br>
I don’t need the gazes outside the window<br>

I want to know the “me” inside myself more<br>
I wanna be a cat<br><br>

I wanna be a cat<br><br>
I wanna be a cat

On top of the snug sofa<br>
The morning sunlight pouring in<br>
Continuously makes me roll around inside the cozy blanket<br>
Inside this slowly flowing time<br>
I dream a new dream everyday<br>
This slow and leisure daily life, this time is what I like<br><br>

This time that passes will never comeback<br>
Don’t care for anybody else, this moment only for yourself<br><br>

The shaking curtains, the feel-good breeze<br>
It tickles me as if it’s trying to whisper into my ear<br>
Wherever it is I like it, Whenever it is I like it<br>
That gently blowing breeze is calling for me<br>
I want to walk more, do you want to join<br>
Do you want to walk inside the breeze with me<br><br>

The feel-good breeze<br>
The slow flowing moment, and you<br>
Don’t worry about anything, that’s more than enough, that’s all you need<br><br>

I like the way it is right now woo<br>
I don’t need the gazes outside the window<br>

Ah, inside the door gap that has opened carefully<br>
A small light shines on me<br>
Follow my footsteps one by one, stay close and believe in yourself<br><br>

I like whichever sort of image you have woo<br>
You’re more important than the gazes outside the window<br>
Because you are the one that’s more important than anything else<br>
Just the way you want it<br>
I wanna be a cat<br><br>

No matter how much we love each other<br>
Suddenly suddenly<br>
our relationship ends<br>
It's not about possibilities, but mistakes of the heart<br>
mistakes in fate<br>
But it was a truly wonderful love<br><br>
 
A happy goodbye<br>
Can't shed no tears<br>
I'm feeling fine<br>
Because I still love you and that doesn't change<br>
Goodbye with a smile<br>
Thank you for so many memories<br>
Thank you<br>
Somehow happy<br>
I won't be able to see you tomorrow, but I pretend to be strong<br>
Strange<br><br>
 
Why, why don't I feel sad?<br>
Even though everyone is worried about me<br>
Because I knew that I'd wake up from my dream someday<br>
on the expiration date of love<br>
Looking back, I have no regrets<br>
No regret saying goodbye to you<br>
Don't need no consolation<br>
No need<br><br>
 
For some reason, now I don't feel lonely at all<br>
Goodbye facing forward<br>
You pushed my back and gave me courage<br>
You've been a nice person.<br>
I'm glad I met you<br>
Heartbreak<br>
The best‼︎<br><br>
 
Please go now<br>
Right now<br>
Please turn away from me<br>
If you look at me I will change my mind<br>
While it's still positive, let's close the door of love<br>
I don't want to hate you<br>
I wanted an ideal goodbye<br>
It was my wish<br>
Even though such parting cannot exist<br><br>
 
A happy goodbye<br>
Can't shed no tears<br>
I'm feeling fine<br>
Because I still love you and that doesn't change<br>
Goodbye with a smile.<br>
Thank you for so many memories<br>
Thank you<br>
Somehow happy<br>
I won't be able to see you tomorrow, but I pretend to be strong<br>
Strange<br><br>
 
A happy goodbye
